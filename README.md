## Features

- Traffic sign classification using CNN architecture
- Interactive GUI interface for easy usage
- Support for multiple traffic sign categories
- Pre-trained model included
- High accuracy in classification

## Project Structure

- `GUI.ipynb`: Interactive GUI implementation for the system
- `traffic_signs.ipynb`: Main notebook containing model training and evaluation
- `traffic_classifier.h5/.keras`: Trained model files
- `Train.csv`, `Test.csv`: Dataset files for training and testing
- `Meta.csv`: Metadata information
- `data/`: Directory containing dataset images

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas opencv-python matplotlib jupyter
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook to run the GUI:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook GUI.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

1. Open `GUI.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Run all cells to start the GUI interface
3. Upload an image of a traffic sign through the interface
4. The system will process the image and display the predicted traffic sign class

## Model Information

The system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained on a comprehensive dataset of traffic signs. The model achieves high accuracy in classifying various traffic sign categories.
